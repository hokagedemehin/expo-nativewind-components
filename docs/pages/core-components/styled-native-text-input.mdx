## Styled Native Text Input

This component is build on React Native TextInput which is a basic component that allows the user to enter text. It has an `onChangeText` prop that can be used to update the state of the text input. There are also other events, such as `onSubmitEditing` and onFocus that can be subscribed to.

## Usage

```tsx filename="App.tsx" showLineNumbers copy
import { StyledWindTextInput, StyledWindView } from "expo-nativewind-components";
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("");

  return (
    <StyledWindView className="flex-1 justify-center items-center">
      <StyledWindTextInput
        className="border-2 border-gray-500 p-2"
        placeholder="Type here..."
        onChangeText={(text) => setText(text)}
        value={text}
      />
